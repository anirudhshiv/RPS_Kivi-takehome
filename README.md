# # Implementation
Rock Paper Scissors game implementation

This is the core fn, script calls in in a while loop:
> play_rps("","")
* Accepts only lower case "r","p","s"
* While loop terinates only when user picks "n" or "N" for "Play again? (Y/N)" prompt, any other other input triggers a new game

# # Testing
play_rps is called with all different permutations so it is exhaustively tested
